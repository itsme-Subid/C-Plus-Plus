# [C++ Basic Programs (Smart Coding)](https://github.com/itsme-Subid/C-Plus-Plus)

The agenda of this repository is to help others and myself too.
I personally found it very useful for many times, generally I code a program but forget it very frequently, so this repository help by easy accessibility to my code and also easy to go through the programs.
 
## Installation `G++`

Install `G++` to Compile the C++ Programs

- Get the latest version of GCC via [tdm-gcc](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/), which provides up-to-date native builds of `G++`, tdm-gcc, and other helpful C/C++ tools and libraries. You can download the latest installer from the tdm page or use this [link to the installer](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/).

- Follow the Installation instructions on the [tdm-gcc](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/) website to install G++. Take care to run actual tdm-gcc executable.

## Check your G++ installation
To check that your GCC tools are correctly installed and available, open a new Command Prompt and type:

```bash
g++ --version
gdb --version
```
> **Note**: If you don't see the expected output or `g++ or gdb is not a recognized command`. Make sure you followed the instructions on the [tdm-gcc website](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/) to install GCC.

## Run Program

Go to the Project Directory and open `Command Prompt`
```bash
  cd C:\Users\{User Name}\Documents\{Project Directory}
```

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:itsme-Subid/C-Plus-Plus.git .
```

Compile Program
